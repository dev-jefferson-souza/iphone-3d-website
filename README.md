This is an introductory project related to responsive 3D animations with React.

<h3>:white_check_mark: Project Completed</h3>
I was able to complete the project with the help of the 3D animation course with React available on the <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org<a/> YouTube channel.

The animations are completely responsive, whether for desktop, tablet or mobile. I aimed to provide smooth and breathtaking animations regardless of the platform the user is using.

<h3>:compass: In this project I was able to...</h3>
Learn how to create 3D animations with React, using technologies such as WebGi (developed by Three.js) and GSAP. Discover where and how to find 3D models and use the WebGi online editor to generate the scenes that will be used in the animation. In addition, I also learned how to optimize 3D animations for devices with smaller screens, such as tablets and smartphones. Finally, I deployed the project on Netlify.

<h3>:pencil2: Credits</h3>
I believe that without the content provided by the tutorial made by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBu5ulO4d-d47lAVybpRTkw">Code with Sloba channel<a/> and reposted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp">freeCodeCamp.org<a/>, it would not be possible to absorb the knowledge necessary for the development of this application so quickly.

That being said, I think that sharing the acquired knowledge is the best way to thank for the provided content. So, if you are interested in acquiring all this incredible content covered in this project, just click <a href="https://youtu.be/IyBhFma4H1A">this link<a/> and you will be directed to the course used.
